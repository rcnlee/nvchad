* create private repo and personal access token (settings -> developer settings)
* git config --global credential.helper cache (to cache credentials, first time use PAT as the password)
* git remote add rcnlee https://rcnlee@github.com/rcnlee/nvchad
* git fetch --unshallow origin
* git push rcnlee
* added nvim-tmux-navigator custom plugin and override 

Future Installs:
* install latest neovim from source
